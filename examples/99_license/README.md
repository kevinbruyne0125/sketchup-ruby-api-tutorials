# Hello License

This examples demonstrates how to implement license checks to your Ruby
extension using the Ruby API.

To use the License API you need to be a vendor on Extension Warehouse. The
extension must also be distributed via Extension Warehouse for the license
to work.

Developers can obtain test licenses via Extension Warehouse when logged into
their vendor account.
